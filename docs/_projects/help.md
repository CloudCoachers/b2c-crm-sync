> **Your First Stop If You Experience Problems**<br> We'll use these pages to capture troubleshooting guidance that is too deep or detailed to include in the [ReadMe.md](https://sfb2csa.link/b2c-crm-sync/readme).  Our project is new, so we don't have much to show you just yet.  As we build our troubleshooting guidance, we'll share it with you here.

### Always Check Our Issues List
We actively curate and work through issues in our [issues listing](https://github.com/sfb2csolutionarchitects/b2c-crm-sync/issues).  It you're experiencing an issue, check the issues-list to see if it's been captured.  If not, please create a [new issue](https://github.com/sfb2csolutionarchitects/b2c-crm-sync/issues/new) describing your scenario.  You can also [start a discussion](https://github.com/sfb2csolutionarchitects/b2c-crm-sync/discussions/new) and share your experience.
