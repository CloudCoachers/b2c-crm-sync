### Why We Developed b2c-crm-sync
[b2c-crm-sync](https://sfb2csa.link/b2c-crm-sync) was developed to accomplish a number of common goals shared by Architect Success and Architects across Salesforce and ecosystem partners:

- Raise the floor on which Partners, Customers, and Salesforce Archtiects design and deliver multi-cloud customer experiences.
- Operationalize the B2C Customer Data Strategy evangelized by the [B2C Solution Architect Program](https://sfb2csa.link/resources) and Integrated Customer Experiences teams (authors of the [Salesforce Customer 360 Guides](https://sfb2csa.link/guides).
- Provide a contemporary and extensible POV on how to integrate B2C Commerce and the Salesforce Platform -- leveraging declarative tools and capabilities to facilitate the integration.
- Simplify the setup and deployment process for this multi-cloud enablement solution by baking CI-based deployment tooling into the solution that eliminates the manual configuration normally required.
- Share a service-framework that can be used to progressively identify anonymous and registered B2C Commerce Customers -- and synchronize those customer profiles with corresponding Salesforce Platform Contacts and Marketing Cloud Subscriber records.

Our B2C Commerce, Service, and Marketing Platforms are amazing to innovate on.  They provide an amazing platform foundation that can be used by companies worldwide to deliver customer experiences that inspire loyalty and maximize the business value promise of our platform.  That said, Architects need support and guidance on how to implement the best-practices we recommend at Salesforce.

And simply put -- this is what b2c-crm-sync represents; an enablement solution designed to support Architects, customers, and partners on how to stand-up the integration between B2C Commerce and the Salesforce Platform that unlocks frictionless customer experiences across our portfolio of products.
