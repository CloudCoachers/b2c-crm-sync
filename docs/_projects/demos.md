### Watch a Replay of our 1st Learning Lab on B2C Customer Data Strategy

In early April of 2021, we conducted our first [Learning Lab for the B2C Solution Architect Program](https://b2csa-officehours.hubs.vidyard.com/watch/dZPP3KV12U545oqP6m9huF).  In this lab, we explained why companies and partners must incorporate data strategy into their customer experience planning and delivery priorities.

We also introduced [b2c-crm-sync](https://sfb2csa.link/b2c-crm-sync) as an enablement solution that can be used to operationalize our B2C Customer Data Strategy -- and accelerate the delivery of multi-cloud customer experiences that are frictionless.
