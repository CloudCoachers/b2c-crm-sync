# Salesforce B2C Commerce / Customer 360 Platform Integration #

## Introduction ##

Salesforce B2C Commerce / CRM Sync is an enablement solution provided by the Salesforce Architect Success Team designed to teach Salesforce's B2C Customer Data Strategy for multi-cloud use-cases.  The solution demonstrates a contemporary approach to the integration between Salesforce B2C Commerce and the Salesforce Customer 360 Platform.  This project provides a framework for integrating these two clouds leveraging REST APIs and the declarative capabilities of the Salesforce Platform to power frictionless customer experiences across B2C Commerce, Service, and Marketing Clouds.

##### Now Supporting PersonAccounts AND Accounts / Contacts
We've just merged in our updates to support both PersonAccounts and Accounts / Contacts as customerModels within the Salesforce Platform.  Our overall **Apex unit-test coverage is at 85%**, and we've expanded our suite of [multi-cloud unit tests](test/_use-cases) to exercise almost fifty individual multi-cloud integration test-cases.

> :warning: &nbsp;This repository is currently in **beta** as we continue to harden our tests and the MVP feature-set.  Solution trustworthiness is critical for our success.  Please visit our [issues-list](https://github.com/sfb2csolutionarchitects/b2c-crm-sync/issues) to see outstanding issues and features, and visit our [discussions](https://github.com/sfb2csolutionarchitects/b2c-crm-sync/discussions) to ask questions. &nbsp;:warning:

![Introducing b2c-crm-sync](/docs/images/crm-sync.gif)

> That's correct.  If you have a B2C Commerce Sandbox and a [Salesforce Platform DevHub](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/sfdx_app_dev) -- you can get this integration setup in 15 minutes.

## Application Overview ##

b2c-crm-sync enables the resolution, viewing, and management of Salesforce B2C Commerce Customer Profiles within the Salesforce Platform as either Accounts / Contacts or Person Accounts.  The project serves as foundation for customized integration between B2C Commerce and the Salesforce Platform.  It is designed to teach the data strategy used to synchronize B2C Customer Profiles -- and extended to support multi-cloud use-cases between B2C Commerce, Marketing Cloud, and the Salesforce Platform (ex. Service, Sales, Loyalty Cloud, etc).

> Please note that this integration is an 'above the API' integration achieved via REST services -- and is not a low-level platform integration.  Think of this repository as a guide for integrating B2C Commerce and the Salesforce Customer 360 Platform leveraging REST APIs, custom code, and a subset of its declarative features.

b2c-crm-sync project leverages Salesforce B2C Commerce Open Commerce REST APIs to interact with B2C Customer Profiles -- and a series of Salesforce Platform REST services to 'announce' when relevant custom profiles B2C Commerce have been created or modified. Through these announcements, the Salesforce Platform requests the identified data objects (ex. customers) via REST APIs -- and then ingests elements of those data objects to create Account / Contact or PersonAccount representations of B2C Commerce Customer Profiles.

### Setup Guidance

#### Deployment Considerations
This repository should be considered a developer framework that can be extended by customers and partners to support their specific implementation needs.  Implementing this solution will require configuration, customization, runtime-performance evaluation, and testing.  That said, it should also accelerate your implementation by providing you with a foundation you can build on.

> Do NOT deploy this enablement solution directly to a staging or production environment without first going through your development, QA, or CI process.  Remember that this solution is not supported by Salesforce Technical Support.

#### Environment Requirements
b2c-crm-sync requires a [B2C Commerce Sandbox](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/b2c-on-demand-sandbox) and a [Salesforce DevHub](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.sfdx_setup_enable_devhub.htm&type=5) capable of creating [scratchOrgs](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/quick-start-salesforce-dx).  It can also be deployed to [Salesforce Sandboxes](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.data_sandbox_create.htm&type=5)  leveraging [SFDX and Salesforce's metadata API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_develop_any_org.htm).

> b2c-crm-sync is designed to be deployed to a B2C Commerce Sandbox and Salesforce scratchOrg in 15 minutes following the instructions ourlined in this ReadMe.  Please setup your Salesforce DevHub and SFDX before moving forward with the install process.

#### Node.js Setup Instructions

b2c-crm-sync leverages [node.js enabled CLI](https://github.com/tj/commander.js/) and [SFDX (Salesforce CLI)](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli) commands.  You'll want to ensure that you have [node v15.2.1](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v15.2.1/) running.  If you're new to node, we recommend setting up [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage multiple node versions.

> Use these articles to setup [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) on your local workstation.  It's worth the effort to set this up, as it introduces great flexibility if you have projects that are dependent on specific node versions.

- You can [install nvm on the mac](https://jamesauble.medium.com/install-nvm-on-mac-with-brew-adb921fb92cc) using [brew](https://jamesauble.medium.com/install-nvm-on-mac-with-brew-adb921fb92cc).

- You can also [install nvm on windows](https://dev.to/skaytech/how-to-install-node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows-10-4nbi).

Once you have node installed, you can verify your local node version with the following command:

```bash
node --version
```

> This should return the version number of your active node.js version.  If everything is setup correctly, the command should return **v15.2.1**.

With node.js setup, you can now install the project dependencies with the standard npm install command:

```bash
npm install
```
> Installing the project dependencies will take a moment or two.  Please [log an issue](https://github.com/sfb2csolutionarchitects/b2c-crm-sync/issues/new) if you run into installation issues setting up the project.

Once the install has been completed, you can apply non-breaking updates to node packages that are leveraged by b2c-crm-sync:

```bash
npm audit fix
```

> Please remember that forcing breaking changes with the `--force` option can also break the b2c-crm-sync install process.  This isn't recommended.

#### Install SFDX for SFDC Deployments
b2c-crm-sync also requires [SFDX](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli) -- as it is used to create scratchOrgs and deploy the meta-data that powers it.  You can [verify your SFDX installation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_install_cli.htm) with the following command:

```bash
sfdx --version
```

#### B2C Commerce Setup Instructions

##### Setup the Demo B2C Commerce Storefronts

b2c-crm-sync is designed to work with existing B2C Commerce storefronts.  In the event that you do not have a storefront, you can use the existing leverage [Salesforce's Storefront Reference Architecture](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/cc-digital-for-developers) storefronts provided by Salesforce.  The RefArch and RefArchGlobal storefronts can be installed in any B2C Commerce sandbox using these instructions.

> If you have a B2C Commerce Sandbox, you can install the latest SFRA Build from the Administration Menu.  This **will not impact any other sites** you may have setup in your sandbox environment.

1. Open the Business Manager Administration Menu.
2. Under Site Development, select the `Site Import / Export` menu option.
3. In the import section, select `Storefront Reference Architecture Demo Sites` and click the `Import` Button to continue.
4. Select which SFRA build you'd like to leverage, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the `Deploy` Button to install the site.

> If you are new to B2C Commerce, please use the default SFRA build to deploy in your sandbox.  The deploy and setup process takes about 10 minutes, and your sandbox environment will notify you via email when the deployment is complete and the SFRA storefronts are configured.

##### Setup the RefArchGlobal Site to Use Its Own CustomerList

b2c-crm-sync supports [multiple sites and customerLists](https://documentation.b2c.commercecloud.salesforce.com/DOC2/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.demandware.dochelp%2Fcontent%2Fb2c_commerce%2Ftopics%2Fcustomers%2Fb2c_customer_lists.html).  To see this in action, please ensure that the RefArchGlobal site leverages its own CustomerList.  SFRA ships with multiple customerLists -- but with its default setup, both the RefArch and RefArchGlobal sites are associated to the RefArch customerList.

> b2c-crm-sync's integration tests require that the SFRA RefArchGlobal storefront be associated to its own RefArchGlobal CustomerList. This association can be made by editing the CustomerList association on the RefArchGlobal site.

1. Open the Business Manager Administration Menu.
2. Select the`Manage Sites` option under the Sites menu.
3. Select the `RefArchGlobal` site from the list of available sites by clicking on the siteId.
4. Update the CustomerList association by changing the select value to **RefArchGlobal**.
5. Click `Save` to save your changes.

Please note that this isn't a requirement -- but if you want a 100% pass-rate on our multi-cloud unit tests, you should make this change.  A number of our unit-tests exercise the RefArch and RefArchGlobal customer lists to test our customer resolution business rules.

>  A subset of the Multi-cloud unit tests will fail if your RefArch and RefArchGlobal sites leverage the same customerLists vs. having their own.  If you experience test failures, please review the test description for references to multiple customerLists.

##### Enable the Agent Permissions on the Administrator Role

The Order on Behalf Of (Assisted Shopping) use-case requires that Business Manager users representing Customer Service Agents have B2C Commerce permissions to login and place orders on behalf of registered storefront shoppers.  The Administrator role can be extended to include these permissions.

> In a production environment, a separate role should be created for Agents that provides the minimally required functional permissions.  Do not provide Agents with access to an over-permissioned Administrator role. 

1. Open the Business Manager Administration Menu.
2. Select the `Roles and Permissions` option from the Organization menu.
3. Select the `Administrator` role.
4. Select the `Functional Permissions` tab within the Administrator role properties.
5. Select the `RefArch` and `RefArchGlobal` sites from the Context modal.  This will set the context for permission changes applied to the Administrator role.
6. Click the `Apply` button to view the functional permissions for these sites.
7. Add the following functional permissions to the Administrator role by clicking each permission's checkbox:
    - Login_On_Behalf
    - Login_Agent
    - Adjust_Item_Price
    - Adjust_Shipping_Price
    - Adjust_Order_Price
    - Create_Order_On_Behalf_Of
    - Search_Orders 
    - Handle_External_Orders
    
> The Order on Behalf Of experience minimally requires the `Login_On_Behalf`, `Login_Agent`, and `Create_Order_On_Behalf_Of` functional permissions.  The other permissions can be included to extend the Agent capabilities. 

8. Click `Update` to apply these functional permissions to the Administrator role.

##### Create Your B2C Commerce Client ID

Before setting up the b2c-crm-sync environment, you have to create a B2C Commerce Client ID. This has to be done through the Account Manager Portal. Please follow these steps in order to create the client ID used in the environment bellow:

1. Go to [https://account.demandware.com](https://account.demandware.com)
2. Go to the `API Client` menu
3. Click on the `Add API Client` button at the top right of the page
4. Enter a display name and a password. The password corresponds to the `B2C_CLIENTSECRET` environment variable that you'll setup in the next section.
5. Within the OpenID Connect section, please ensure to configure at least the following:
    1. Default Scopes: `mail`
    2. Allowed Scopes: `mail`, `roles`, `tenantFilter`, and `profile` (on separate lines)
    3. Token Endpoint Auth Method: `client_secret_post`
    4. Access Token Format: `UUID`
6. Click the `Save` button

Re-open the ClientID page -- and keep it open until the last section of the setup.  You'll have to add the callback URL of the Salesforce Core Auth Provider to the Redirect URIs field of your newly created client ID.

> Remember to also capture the password applied to the ClientID.  You will need to add the password to the .env file via the `B2C_CLIENTSECRET` property.

##### Setup a .env File
To begin, we use the [dotenv](https://medium.com/@thejasonfile/using-dotenv-package-to-create-environment-variables-33da4ac4ea8f) node.js library to store environment-specific configuration settings used to authenticate against a given B2C Commerce environment.  Before installing any of the project package dependencies, please follow these instructions to build-out a .env file that contains your environment's configuration settings.

- Rename the example file 'sample.env' to '.env' in the root of the repository.

> This file shouldn't be checked into the repository, and is automatically being ignored by Git

- Open the .env file and edit the following information.  Please update these values to reflect your sandbox environment's configuration properties.

```

The CLI build tools present within this solution will use this information to remotely authenticate against your environment via B2C Commerce REST APIs prior to attempting any import, upload, or re-index activity.  They are also used to automate the creation of Salesforce Platform meta-data describing the B2C Commerce environment and Named Credentials used to access the B2C Commerce instance.

> Prior to saving your file, please verify that the url is correct, and that the clientId / clientSecret are accurate.  The instance name should represent a shorthand nickname for the B2C Commerce environment.  This information must be accurate in order for these activities to successfully process the site-import.

#### Configure Your B2C Commerce OCAPI Permissions
The build scripts in this repository leverage B2C Commerce's [sfcc-ci](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/sfcc-ci) automation library.  This library is used to perform a number of continuous-integration related activities that enable the site-data uploading and import.  Before we can leverage the automation tasks, the Salesforce B2C Commerce environment's OCAPI Data API permissions must be enabled to support remote interactions.

> Yes, we will be porting this to leverage the new B2C Commerce APIs in a future release.  For now, all use-cases can be satisfied via OCAPI.

##### Configure Your Shop API Permissions

> We leverage the Shop API to facilitate enable Headless use-cases, multi-cloud unit tests that can be executed via the CLI, and to support Assisted Shopping (OOBO) via the B2C Commerce storefront.

- Log into the Business Manager.
- Navigate to Administration > Site Development > Open Commerce API Settings.
- Select 'Shop API' and 'Global' from the available select boxes.
- Add the following permission set for your clientId to the existing configuration settings.  Map your allowed-origins to point to your Salesforce environment (you may have to come back and set this after your scratchOrg is created below).
- Always remember to save your changes and confirm that they've been written to your Business Manager environment.

> Remember to replace the **client_id** and **allowed_origins** examples included here with values that reflect your own security and environment configuration settings.

#### Configure Your B2C Commerce WebDAV Permissions
The build scripts in this repository require that the clientId configured in the .env file also have read / write WebDAV permissions.  Please use the following instructions to configure the WebDAV permissions for your clientId.

- Log into the Business Manager.
- Navigate to Administration > Organization > WebDAV Client Permissions.
- Add the following permission sets for your clientId to the existing configuration settings.

> Remember to replace the 'client_id' with the clientId that is configured in your .env file.  If you already have clientId permissions created, please add the resources outlined in the snippet below to the existing clientId configuration.

```json
{
  "clients":
  [
    {
      "client_id":"[-------insert your clientId here---------------]",
      "permissions":[

### Setup Instructions for the Salesforce Customer 360 Platform

#### Setup ScratchOrg Creation and Management Preferences
All Salesforce Customer 360 Platform code and meta-data can be deployed to a [scratch org leveraging SFDX](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/quick-start-salesforce-dx).  CLI commands in this repository support automation of the deployment process, and the .env file can be extended to include additional variables to automate B2C Commerce service and metadata configuration.

> Please use [Trailhead's Quick Start: Salesforce DX](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/quick-start-salesforce-dx) as a guide to setup a DevHub that can generate Salesforce scratchOrgs.

- Open the .env file and edit the following information.  Please use these defaults -- and edit them to accommodate your org creation and deployment preferences.

> ScratchOrgs can be configured using the [base](./config-dx/b2c-base-scratch-def.json) or [personaccounts](./config-dx/b2c-personaccounts-scratch-def.json) profiles.   The base profile supports Accounts / Contacts, while the personaccounts profile supports PersonAccounts.

```

SF_SCRATCHORGPROFILE=base
SF_SCRATCHORGALIAS=crmsync
SF_SCRATCHORGSETDEFAULT=true
SF_SCRATCHORGFORCEOVERWRITE=true
SF_SCRATCHORGDURATIONDAYS=7
```
The following table describes each of the Scratch Org specific .env file variables that are leveraged by b2c-crm-sync's build and deployment tools.

| Property Name | Required | Description                       |
|--------------:|:----:|:-----------------------------------|
|  SF_SCRATCHORGPROFILE |x| Represents the scratchOrg profile to leverage when creating an org (use either 'base' or 'personaccounts') |
|  SF_SCRATCHORGALIAS | | Describes the alias to apply to created scratchOrgs |
|  SF_SCRATCHORGSETDEFAULT | | Manages whether any newly created scratchOrgs should automatically be set as the default|
|  SF_SCRATCHORGFORCEOVERWRITE | | Manages whether deployments to a scratchOrg should force overwrite the code and meta-data present in the scratchOrg |
|  SF_SCRATCHORGDURATIONDAYS | | Specify the scratch org's duration, which indicates when the scratch org expires in days (7 - 30). |

The build tools will use this information to create scratchOrgs, set default preferences, and control whether deployments should force overwrites to their target environment.

> Prior to saving your file, please verify that the scratchOrg profile uses one of the two supported values ('base' or 'personaccounts').  Any values not set will automatically default to base preferences managed via the /config/default.js configuration file.

You will leverage the .env file's configuration properties to dramatically simplify the build and deployment of b2c-crm-sync.  Check the package.json for the complete set of CLI commands that can be used to automate meta-data generation, service definition creation, and validate environment configurations prior to deployment.


### Deployment Instructions
The b2c-crm-sync repository includes a collection of CLI commands that can be used to prepare and deploy the b2c-crm-sync assets to B2C Commerce and a Salesforce Customer 360 Platform scratchOrg.  

The CLI commands are designed to run off of the [.env file](sample.env) configuration.  They also include support for command-line argument equivalents of the .env configuration values.  Lastly, each command has an associated [api method](lib/cli-api) that can be leveraged from within custom deployment scripts.

> Before running any commands below be sure to run `npm install` from the root of the b2c-crm-sync repository folder.  These commands are dependent on the project successfully being installed in your workspace.  You can inspect the complete collection of commands via the [package.json](package.json)'s scripts section.

### B2C Commerce Sandbox Configuration Instructions

1. Setup the B2C Commerce storefront(s) that will be used to exercise b2c-crm-sync.  If you do not have a storefront, you can use the demo SFRA storefronts available in any B2C Commerce sandbox.

2. Configure the initial collection B2C Commerce OCAPI and WebDAV permissions.  The `allowed_origins` properties can be set after a Salesforce ScratchOrg has been created.

3. Setup the Agent permissions on the Administrator role.  This is a requirement if you'd like to exercise the Order on Behalf of use-case.

4. Create the B2C Commerce .env configuration properties.

5. Execute the CLI unit-tests to verify that the CLI install, setup, and configuration is working as expected.

```bash
npm run crm-sync:test:cli
```

> Please note that not all CLI commands have test-coverage (most of the B2C commands do, only some SFDC commands do).  That said, you shouldn't expect to see any test failures.  We're always looking for more tests -- if you're interested in an Architect Success Hoody.

6. Execute the B2C Commerce unit-tests to verify that the B2C Commerce cartridge and OCAPI Hook code is trustworthy.

```bash
npm run crm-sync:test:b2c
```

> Like with the CLI tests, you shouldn't expect to see any failures when exercising the B2C unit-tests.

### Validate Your .env B2C Commerce Sandbox Credentials

7. Verify that your B2C Commerce configuration properties are defined accurately in the .env file by executing the following CLI command:

```bash
npm run crm-sync:b2c:verify
```
> This command will verify that the credentials, clientId / clientSecret, code-version, and specified sites can all be verified against the host specified in the .env file.  Errors will be reported to the console.

Please note that the code-version specified in the .env file must be valid in order for the verify command to complete successfully.  The code version must be accurate to deploy the B2C Commerce SFRA cartridges that are leveraged by b2c-crm-sync.

8. Create the Salesforce ScratchOrg .env configuration properties.  Follow the guidance above, and specify the type of scratchOrg to generate.

> The 'base' scratchOrg profile supports Accounts and Contacts.  The 'personaccounts' scratchOrg profile supports PersonAccounts.  If any other value is provided, the 'base' profile will be defaulted.

### Verify Salesforce DevHub Access

9. List your supported Salesforce DevHubs, scratchOrgs, and their connected status.  You can use this command to verify that your DevHub is available.

```bash
sfdx force:org:list --all
```
> Please refer to [Salesforce DX Usernames and Orgs](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_cli_usernames_orgs.htm), the [SFDX Org command-set](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_reference.meta/sfdx_cli_reference/cli_reference_force_org.htm), and the [Salesforce Platform DevHub Trail](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/sfdx_app_dev) for resources on how to manage scratchOrgs.

10. Specify your default DevHub username by executing the following CLI command.  The devHubOrg-username this represent the DevHub that will host your scratchOrg.  Please see [Enable Dev Hub Features in Your Org](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.sfdx_setup_enable_devhub.htm&type=5) for details on how to setup a DevHub environment.

```bash
sfdx config:set defaultdevhubusername=[devHubOrg-username]
```

> If you experience the error **ERROR running config:set: No AuthInfo found for name [dev hub username]**, please authenticate against the selected DevHub using the [web:login SFDX command](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_reference.meta/sfdx_cli_reference/cli_reference_auth_web.htm).

Authenticate against your Salesforce DevHub by executing the following CLI command:

```bash
sfdx auth:web:login
```

The [web:login command](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_reference.meta/sfdx_cli_reference/cli_reference_auth_web.htm) supports multiple arguments to enable authentication against registered orgs (via the `-d -a [DebHub]` alias) or authenticate against new orgs (via the `-r [login-url]` option).

> Once executed, this command should open the Salesforce org in your browser and allow you to authenticate against the specified org with valid credentials.  You should only need to execute this command when connecting to a new DevHub, and you can use the `sfdx config:set defaultdevhubusername=[devHubOrg-username]` to make this specific org your default DevHub.

After you have successfully authenticated against your DevHub, you can move forward with generating a new ScratchOrg.

### Create a ScratchOrg and Deploy b2c-crm-sync

11. Generate the Salesforce metadata required by b2c-crm-sync, create a scratchOrg, and deploy the b2c-crm-sync Salesforce Platform code by executing the following CLI command:

```bash
npm run crm-sync:sf:build
```

> This CLI command automates the steps outlined above.  Automation results will be output through the CLI.  If successful, a browser tab will be opened to the created scratchOrg.

12.  In your scratchOrg, enter Setup and find the User avatar in the header (the avatar should look like Astro, and be displayed in the upper right corner of the browser.  Hovering over Astro will display the label "View Profile".

13.  Click on the User avatar and select the option titled **Settings**.  From the settings menu, click on the option titled **Reset Security Token** to generate a new token for your scratchOrg user.

> Please note that you will receive two emails declaring that a new securityToken has been generated.  The first is from the password reset that was performed.  The second is from this action.  Copy the securityToken from the second email to the .env file.

#### Setup .env Salesforce ScratchOrg Authentication Credentials
B2C Commerce service definitions pointing to the deployed scratchOrg can be seeded with Salesforce environment authentication credentials.  To support this, please extend the .env file with the following properties representing authentication details for the scratchOrg.

- Open the .env file and edit the following information.  Please update these values to reflect the unique environment and authentication credentials for your scratchOrg.

These values can be used to validate authentication and seed the B2C Commerce service definitions with these details -- eliminating the need to manually configure these services.  You can use the following npm command to output a copyable representation of these values:

```bash
npm run crm-sync:sf:user:details
```

> This command will output the hostName, loginUrl, userName, and Password for your scratchOrg user.  You can copy this to the clipboard and paste it in your .env file.

SF_PASSWORD=P@ssw0rd!
SF_SECURITYTOKEN=5aqzr1tpENbIpiWt1E9X2ruOV
```
> The following table describes each of the Salesforce Customer 360 Platform's .env file variables that are leveraged by b2c-crm-sync's build and deployment tools to automate the creation of service definitions.

| Property Name | Required | Description                       |
|--------------:|:----:|:-----------------------------------|
|  SF_HOSTNAME |x| Describes the url for the scratchOrg being integrated with a B2C Commerce instance.|

|  SF_PASSWORD |x| Represents the password of the scratchOrg user.  See [Generate or Change a Password for a Scratch Org User](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_scratch_orgs_passwd.htm) for additional information. |
|  SF_SECURITYTOKEN |x| Represents the securityToken of the scratchOrg user. You can create or reset the security token from your scratchOrg User Settings under 'Reset My Security Token.'|

The build tools will use this information to create the B2C Commerce service definitions used by it to communicate with the Salesforce scratchOrg.

#### Update the .env File With Your Salesforce ScratchOrg Credentials

14.  Ensure that the following .env Salesforce Platforms scratchOrg configuration properties displayed via the CLI output after the scratchOrg was successfully deployed.

```
######################################################################
## Salesforce Platform Configuration Properties
######################################################################
SF_HOSTNAME=power-dream-1234-dev-ed.lightning.force.com
SF_LOGINURL=test.salesforce.com
SF_USERNAME=test-2enmvjmefudl@example.com
SF_PASSWORD=P@ssw0rd!
SF_SECURITYTOKEN=5aqzr1tpENbIpiWt1E9X2ruOV
```

Remember that these values need to be driven by your scratchOrg user and environment.  These values must be accurate to ensure that the B2C Commerce meta-data is successfully generated and supports the integration with the Salesforce Platform.

> Don't forget to [reset the securityToken](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.user_security_token.htm&type=5) for your scratchOrg user.  This has to be done manually and is not included with the output generated by the `npm run crm-sync:sf:user:details` command.

Once your token has been reset, check your email for the reset notification from your Salesforce scratchOrg.  Copy the securityToken from the email to the SF_SECURITYTOKEN property of your .env file.

> Do not proceed with the next step until your securityToken has been reset and copied to your .env file.  You authentication attempt **will faill** if you attempt it without the securityToken.

#### Validate Your .env Salesforce ScratchOrg Credentials

15.  Test your Salesforce Platform Configuration properties by executing the following CLI Command:

```bash
npm run crm-sync:sf:auth:usercreds
```

> This command will attempt to authenticate against the Salesforce scratchOrg using the environment and credential information provided in the previous step.  The CLI command will either return an error -- or return the authToken that was generated by the Salesforce Platform in response to the authentication request.

:warning: &nbsp; Only proceed to the next steps if you are able to successfully validate that your Salesforce Platform Configuration Properties are able to successfully authenticate against your scratchOrg. &nbsp; :warning:

#### Configure Account Manager as a Salesforce AuthProvider

16. Now that the scratch org has been created, the b2c-crm-sync package has been deployed, and the credentials of the user validated, you have to build the Auth Provider that will allow the Salesforce core platform to authenticate with the B2C instance. To do so, please execute the following CLI Command:

```bash
npm run crm-sync:sf:authprovider:build
```

> This command will create the Auth Provider into the scratch org and then deploy the related Named Credentials that will leverage it. This named credential is then used by the b2c-crm-sync package to perform API calls against the B2C Commerce instance.

17. By executing the `crm-sync:sf:authprovider:build` command, the callback URL of the auth provider will be printed in the CLI console. Please copy this URL and paste it in the Redirect URIs field of the previously created Account Manager Client ID.

> If you don't find the callback URL of the Auth Provider within the CLI console, you can find it from the Salesforce org. To do so, please go to the `Setup` menu, then type in the Quick Find field and search for `Auth. Providers` and open the Auth provider named with the B2C Commerce instance name. You'll find the callback URL at the bottom of the page.

#### Setup the AuthProvider Callback in Account Manager

18. Now that both the Auth Provider and the related Named Credentials are deployed, you have to perform a first authentication from the Salesforce Core platform. This step is manual as it requires you to validate the authentication flow.

- To perform this action. please go, on the scratch org, to the `Setup` menu.
- Type in the Quick Find field and search for `Named Credentials`.
- In front of the `<b2c instance name>: B2C: Client Credentials` named credentials, click on the edit button.
- Immediately click on `Save`. Performing an edit of the named credential will start the authentication process behind the scene between the Salesforce core org and the B2C Commerce instance.

> You should be able to see that the named credential has been successfully authenticated when opening back the named credential, as per the following screenshot:

![Successfully authenticated B2C Commerce Named Credential](/docs/images/B2C-Authenticated-Named-Credential.png)

#### Configure Duplicate Rules Leveraged by b2c-crm-sync

b2c-crm-sync leverages match and duplicate rules to enforce the B2C Customer Data Strategy it employs.  These rules are leveraged to alert administrators of potential duplicate B2C Commerce Customer Profiles -- and assist in resolving customer profiles using a sub-set of customer attributes.

19. In the setup quick-find, search for Duplicate Rules (searching for 'dup' should bring up Duplicate and Match Rules).  Once located, select the Match Rules setup option from the filtered setup menu.

##### Account / Contact Match Rules Setup Guidance

> If you are setting up PersonAccounts, please skip this section and proceed to the section titled [PersonAccount Match Rules Setup Guidance](#personaccount-match-rules-setup-guidance).

- Ensure that the **B2C Commerce: Standard Contacts** Match rule is activated.  This rule must be active in the scratchOrg as part of the Accounts / Contacts implementation.  The corresponding duplicate rule is dependent on this Match Rule being activated.

##### Account / Contact Duplicate Rules Setup Guidance

From the duplicate rules listing, select the rule titled **B2C Commerce: Standard Contacts**.  Edit the rule from the detail display.

- Activate the Duplicate Rule by checking the activation checkbox.
- Under the Conditions section near the bottom of the form display, click on the link labeled 'Add Filter Logic'.
- Paste the following filter logic value in the field -- and save your results.

```bash
1 OR (2 AND 3) OR (2 AND 4 AND 5) OR (2 AND 4) OR (4 AND 5 AND 6)
```

##### PersonAccount Match Rules Setup Guidance

- Ensure that the **B2C Commerce Standard Person Account** match rule is activated.  This rule must be active in the scratchOrg as part of the PersonAccounts implementation.  The corresponding Duplicate Rule is dependent on this Match Rule being activated.

- Ensure that the **B2C Commerce: Standard Contacts** match rule is deactivated.  This rule must be not activated as part of the PersonAccounts implementation.

> The B2C Commerce: Standard Contacts should automatically be deactivated as part of the PersonAccounts meta-data deployment.

##### PersonAccount Duplicate Rules Setup Guidance

Leveraging the PersonAccount implementation requires a handful of additional configuration steps to disable the Contact match and duplicate rules -- and enable the related PersonAccount rules.

> The PersonAccount match and duplicate rules are disabled by default -- and must be activated manually through the Setup options of your Salesforce Org.

From the duplicate rules listing, select the rule titled **B2C Commerce: Standard Person Accounts**.  Edit the rule from the detail display.

- Activate the Duplicate Rule by checking the activation checkbox.
- Under the Conditions section near the bottom of the form display, click on the link labeled 'Add Filter Logic'.
- Paste the following filter logic value in the field -- and save your results.

```bash
1 OR (2 AND 3) OR (2 AND 4 AND 5) OR (2 AND 4) OR (4 AND 5 AND 6)
```

#### Configure Your B2C Instance

With the AuthProvider verified and match rules in place, you are now in a position to conduct your first test of the integration between B2C Commerce and the Salesforce Platform.

20. Open the appLauncher, and search for 'CRM' in the quick-find. Verify that the **B2C CRM Sync** application is visible.

> Select the **B2C CRM Sync** application and open it.  Verify that the B2C Instances, B2C CustomerLists, B2C Sites, Accounts, and Contacts tabs are visible from within the application.

- Click on the B2C Instances Tab, and verify that a record exists in the record listing.

> The instance definition should match the B2C Commerce Sandbox definition present in your .env file.  If the instance definition does not match your .env file -- please re-generate your Salesforce scratchOrg.

- Select the pre-configured B2C instance.  A record should already exist that is mapped to the B2C Commerce environment defined in your .env file.

- Select the drop-down arrow next to the 'Printable View' quick action in the top right of the B2C Instance record detail view and select 'Seed CustomerLists and Sites'.

> This will retrieve the configured list of B2C CustomerLists and Sites from the B2C Instance.  These records will be seeded in the b2c-crm-sync application, and will drive integration with B2C Commerce.

- Select the drop-down arrow next to the 'Printable View' quick action in the top right of the B2C Instance record detail view and select 'Activate B2C CustomerLists'.

> This will enable all retrieved CustomerLists for integration with B2C Commerce.  All integration capabilities for CustomerLists can be managed via the Active and Permission Flags on the B2C Commerce Instance, CustomerList, and Site records.

#### Build and Deploy b2c-crm-sync to Your Commerce Cloud Sandbox

21. Generate the B2C Commerce metadata required by b2c-crm-sync and deploy both the code metadata to the Salesforce B2C Commerce instance by executing the following CLI command:

```bash
npm run crm-sync:b2c:build
```
> This CLI command will generate the services.xml file based on the previously generated connected apps step #4, generate a zip archive containing the metadata required by b2c-crm-sync, deploy this archive, generate a zip archive containing the b2c-crm-sync cartridges and deploy this archive to the B2C Commerce instance.

### Salesforce Customer 360 Platform Configuration Instructions

#### Validate Your Installation
You can validate your installation by executing the Salesforce Platform Apex unit tests as well as the b2c-crm-sync multi-cloud unit-tests that are included with this enablement solution.

##### Executing Apex Tests
Apex unit-tests can be executed directly from the command-line via SFDX.  Please use this command to execute the Apex unit tests that are included with b2c-crm-sync:

```bash
sfdx force:apex:test:run
```
> The Apex unit-tests should return with a message providing instructions on how to view the test results.  For additional SFDX commands related to executing Apex tests, please visit the [Salesforce Platform CLI Refernece: Apex Commands](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_reference.meta/sfdx_cli_reference/cli_reference_force_apex.htm) page.

##### Executing Multi-Cloud Unit Tests
The multi-cloud unit-tests are designed to exercise your B2C Commerce Sandbox and Salesforce Platform ScratchOrg via REST APIs to validate the installation is successful.

> The B2C Commerce interactions are dependent on the deployment of the **RefArch and RefArchGlobal sites**.  Each site should be associated to its own separate CustomerList.

> :warning: &nbsp; Do not associate both sites to the same CustomerList -- as this will cause tests dependent on multiple customer-lists to fail. &nbsp; :warning:

Exercise the multi-cloud unit-tests by executing the following CLI command.  These tests exercise integration from both B2C Commerce and the Salesforce Platform:

```bash
npm run crm-sync:test:use-cases
```

> This CLI command will execute the multi-cloud unit tests designed to validate the Salesforce environment's duplicate management configuration, bi-directional customer profile synchronization between B2C Commerce and the Salesforce Platform, and progressive customer resolution scenarios.

#### What's Next?
At this point, you should be in a position to 1) start exercising the integration or 2) [ask a question](https://github.com/sfb2csolutionarchitects/b2c-crm-sync/discussions/new) or [log an issue](https://github.com/sfb2csolutionarchitects/b2c-crm-sync/issues/new) if the installation and configuration didn't complete as expected.  Please share your experience with us. :grin:

#### Let's End with Gratitude
I'd like to extend a heartfelt and personal thank you to everyone for their support, contributions, and guidance.  This has been a multi-year effort spanning multiple teams at Salesforce.  We've developed this data strategy and integration approach leveraging learnings from customers, partners, and our internal teams.  I am grateful for these relationships, and this project would not have come to life without the support of this group.
