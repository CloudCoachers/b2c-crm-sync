# Salesforce B2C Commerce / Customer 360 Platform Integration #

## Introduction ##

Salesforce B2C Commerce / CRM Sync is an enablement solution provided by Salesforce Architect Success designed to teach Salesforce's B2C Customer Data Strategy for multi-cloud use-cases.  The solution demonstrates a contemporary view on the integration between Salesforce B2C Commerce and the Salesforce Customer 360 Platform.  This project provides a framework to integrating these two clouds leveraging public REST APIs to share and synchronize customer profile data between the two clouds.

##### Now Supporting PersonAccounts AND Accounts / Contacts
We've just merged in our updates to support both PersonAccounts and Accounts / Contacts as customerModels within the Salesforce Platform.  Our overall **Apex unit-test coverage is at 83%**, and we've expanded our suite of [multi-cloud unit tests](test/_use-cases) to exercise over forty individual test-cases.

> That's correct.  If you have a B2C Commerce Sandbox and a [Salesforce Platform DevHub](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/sfdx_app_dev) -- you can get this integration setup in 15 minutes.

## Application Overview ##

###### This section provides a high-level summary of the purpose and architectural structure of the Salesforce B2C Commerce and Salesforce Customer 360 Platform Integration.

The b2c-crm-sync project enables the viewing and management of Salesforce B2C Commerce Customer Profiles within the Salesforce Platform as either Accounts / Contacts or Person Accounts.  The project serves as a contemporary foundation for integration between B2C Commerce and the Salesforce Platform.  It is designed to teach the data strategy used to synchronize B2C Customer Profiles -- and extended to support multi-cloud use-cases between B2C Commerce, Marketing Cloud, and the Salesforce Platform (ex. Service, Sales, Loyalty Cloud, etc).

> Please note that this integration is an 'above the API' integration achieved via REST services -- and is not a low-level platform integration.  Think of this repository as a guide for integrating B2C Commerce and the Salesforce Customer 360 Platform leveraging REST APIs, custom code, and a subset of its declarative features.

The b2c-crm-sync project leverages Salesforce B2C Commerce Open Commerce REST APIs to interact with B2C Customer Profiles -- and a series of Salesforce Platform REST services to 'announce' when relevant custom profiles B2C Commerce have been created or modified. Through these announcements, the Salesforce Platform requests the identified data objects (ex. customers) via REST APIs -- and then ingests elements of those data objects to create Account / Contact or PersonAccount representations of B2C Commerce Customer Profiles.

### Setup Guidance

#### Deployment Considerations
This repository should be considered a developer framework that can be extended by customers and partners to support their specific implementation needs.  Implementing this solution will require configuration, customization, runtime-performance evaluation, and testing.  That said, it should also accelerate your implementation by providing you with a foundation you can build on.

> Do NOT deploy this enablement solution directly to a staging or production environment without first going through your development, QA, or CI process.  Remember that this solution is not supported by Salesforce Technical Support.

#### Node.js Setup Instructions

b2c-crm-sync leverages [node.js enabled CLI](https://github.com/tj/commander.js/) and [SFDX (Salesforce CLI)](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli) commands.  You'll want to ensure that you have [node v15.2.1](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v15.2.1/) running.  If you're new to node, we recommend setting up [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage multiple node versions.

> Use these articles to setup [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) on your local workstation.  It's worth the effort to set this up, as it introduces great flexibility if you have projects that are dependent on specific node versions.

- You can [install nvm on the mac](https://jamesauble.medium.com/install-nvm-on-mac-with-brew-adb921fb92cc) using [brew](https://jamesauble.medium.com/install-nvm-on-mac-with-brew-adb921fb92cc).

- You can also [install nvm on windows](https://dev.to/skaytech/how-to-install-node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows-10-4nbi).

Once you have node installed, you can verify your local node version with the following command:

```bash
node --version
```

> This should return the version number of your active node.js version.  If everything is setup correctly, the command should return **v15.2.1**.

With node.js setup, you can now install the project dependencies with the standard npm install command:

```bash
npm install
```
> Installing the project dependencies will take a moment or two.  Please [log an issue](https://github.com/sfb2csolutionarchitects/b2c-crm-sync/issues/new) if you run into installation issues setting up the project.

Remember that [SFDX](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli) is also a requirement -- as we use it to create scratchOrgs and deploy the meta-data that powers b2c-crm-sync.  You can [verify your SFDX installation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_install_cli.htm) with the following command:

```bash
sfdx --version
```

#### About the b2c-crm-sync Library of CLI Commands

b2c-crm-sync includes a library of CLI commands that can be used to validate your setup and incrementally deploy B2C Commerce and Salesforce Platform components to your B2C Commerce sandbox and Salesforce scratchOrg.  We recommend reviewing the [package.json](package.json) to view a complete list of commands available.

> The CLI commands are designed to run off of the [.env file](sample.env) configuration.  They also include support for command-line argument equivalents of the .env configuration values.  Lastly, each command has an associated [api method](lib/cli-api) that can be leveraged from within custom deployment scripts.

#### B2C Commerce Setup Instructions

##### Setup a .env file
To begin, we use the [dotenv](https://medium.com/@thejasonfile/using-dotenv-package-to-create-environment-variables-33da4ac4ea8f) node.js library to store environment-specific configuration settings used to authenticate against a given B2C Commerce environment.  Before installing any of the project package dependencies, please follow these instructions to build-out a .env file that contains your environment's configuration settings.

- Rename the example file 'sample.env' to '.env' in the root of the repository.

> This file shouldn't be checked into the repository, and is automatically being ignored by .git

- Open the .env file and edit the following information.  Please update these values to reflect your sandbox environment's configuration properties.

```

The CLI build tools present within this solution will use this information to remotely authenticate against your environment via B2C Commerce REST APIs prior to attempting any import, upload, or re-index activity.  They are also used to automate the creation of Salesforce Platform meta-data describing the B2C Commerce environment and Named Credentials used to access the B2C Commerce instance.

> Prior to saving your file, please verify that the url is correct, and that the clientId / clientSecret are accurate.  The instance name should represent a shorthand nickname for the B2C Commerce environment.  This information must be accurate in order for these activities to successfully process the site-import.

#### Configure Your B2C Commerce OCAPI Permissions
The build scripts in this repository leverage B2C Commerce's [sfcc-ci](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/sfcc-ci) automation library.  This library is used to perform a number of continuous-integration related activities that enable the site-data uploading and import.  Before we can leverage the automation tasks, the Salesforce B2C Commerce environment's OCAPI Data API permissions must be enabled to support remote interactions.

> Yes, we will be porting this to leverage the new B2C Commerce APIs in a future release.  For now, all use-cases can be satisfied via OCAPI.

##### Configure Your Shop API Permissions

> We leverage the Shop API to facilitate enable Headless use-cases, multi-cloud unit tests that can be executed via the CLI, and to support Assisted Shopping (OOBO) via the B2C Commerce storefront.

- Log into the Business Manager.
- Navigate to Administration > Site Development > Open Commerce API Settings.
- Select 'Shop API' and 'Global' from the available select boxes.
- Add the following permission set for your clientId to the existing configuration settings.  Map your allowed-origins to point to your Salesforce environment (you may have to come back and set this after your scratchOrg is created below).
- Always remember to save your changes and confirm that they've been written to your Business Manager environment.

> In your configuration, please remember to nest these configuration settings inside the clients array.

```json
{
  "_v": "18.8",
  "clients": [
    "insert your updated configuration here" 
  ]
}
```

The following table describes each of the Scratch Org specific .env file variables that are leveraged by b2c-crm-sync's build and deployment tools.

| Property Name | Required | Description                       |
|--------------:|:----:|:-----------------------------------|
|  SF_SCRATCHORGPROFILE |x| Represents the scratchOrg profile to leverage when creating an org (use either 'base' or 'personaccounts') |
|  SF_SCRATCHORGALIAS | | Describes the alias to apply to created scratchOrgs |
|  SF_SCRATCHORGSETDEFAULT | | Manages whether any newly created scratchOrgs should automatically be set as the default|
|  SF_SCRATCHORGFORCEOVERWRITE | | Manages whether deployments to a scratchOrg should force overwrite the code and meta-data present in the scratchOrg |
|  SF_SCRATCHORGDURATIONDAYS | | Specify the scratch org's duration, which indicates when the scratch org expires in days (7 - 30). |

The build tools will use this information to create scratchOrgs, set default preferences, and control whether deployments should force overwrites to their target environment.

> Prior to saving your file, please verify that the scratchOrg profile uses one of the two supported values ('base' or 'personaccounts').  Any values not set will automatically default to base preferences managed via the /config/default.js configuration file.

You will leverage the .env file's configuration properties to dramatically simplify the build and deployment of b2c-crm-sync.  Check the package.json for the complete set of CLI commands that can be used to automate meta-data generation, service definition creation, and validate environment configurations prior to deployment.

### Deployment Instructions
The b2c-crm-sync repository includes a collection of CLI commands that can be used to prepare and deploy the b2c-crm-sync assets to B2C Commerce and a Salesforce Customer 360 Platform scratchOrg.

> Before running any commands below be sure to run 'npm install' from the root of the b2c-crm-sync repository folder.  These commands are dependent on the project successfully being installed in your workspace.

1. Configure the initial collection B2C Commerce OCAPI and WebDAV permissions.  The 'allowed_origins' properties can be set after a Salesforce ScratchOrg has been created.

2. Create the B2C Commerce .env configuration properties.

3. Execute the CLI unit-tests to verify that the CLI install, setup, and configuration is working as expected.

```bash
npm run crm-sync:test:cli
```

> Please note that not all CLI commands have test-coverage (most of the B2C commands do, only some SFDC commands do).  That said, you shouldn't expect to see any test failures.  We're always looking for more tests -- if you're interested in an Architect Success Hoody.

4. Execute the B2C Commerce unit-tests to verify that the B2C Commerce cartridge and OCAPI Hook code is trustworthy.

```bash
npm run crm-sync:test:b2c
```

> Like with the CLI tests, you shouldn't expect to see any failures when exercising the B2C unit-tests.

5. Verify that your B2C Commerce configuration properties are defined accurately in the .env file by executing the following CLI command:

```bash
npm run crm-sync:b2c:verify
```
> This command will verify that the credentials, clientId / clientSecret, code-version, and specified sites can all be verified against the host specified in the .env file.  Errors will be reported to the console.


6. Create the Salesforce ScratchOrg .env configuration properties.  Follow the guidance above, and specify the type of scratchOrg to generate.

> The 'base' scratchOrg profile supports Accounts and Contacts.  The 'personaccounts' scratchOrg profile supports PersonAccounts.  If any other value is provided, the 'base' profile will be defaulted.


7. Specify your default dev hub username by executing the following CLI command, this should be the username of the Environment Hub enabled Org that will host your scratchOrg ([Enable Dev Hub Features in Your Org](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.sfdx_setup_enable_devhub.htm&type=5))

```bash
sfdx config:set defaultdevhubusername=[devHubOrg-username]
```

8. Authenticate with your Environment Hub Org using:

```bash
sfdx auth:web:login
```

9. Generate the Salesforce metadata required by b2c-crm-sync, create a scratchOrg, and deploy the b2c-crm-sync Salesforce Platform code by executing the following CLI command:

```bash
npm run crm-sync:sf:build
```

> This CLI command automates the steps outlined above.  Automation results will be output through the CLI.  If successful, a browser tab will be opened to the created scratchOrg.

:round_pushpin: &nbsp; Please note that the next step should **only be performed if you created a scratchOrg supporting PersonAccounts**.  This step can be skipped if the [base scratchOrg profile](./config-dx/b2c-base-scratch-def.json) was used.

10. If you are deploying a personAccount scratchOrg, you'll also need to manually deploy the Salesforce Platform layout and quickAction elements for PersonAccounts.  The following SFDX command can be used to deploy these elements to your scratchOrg:

> :round_pushpin: &nbsp; As of **04.19.21** -- we've deployed our PersonAccounts implementation.  Please review the [issues list](https://github.com/sfb2csolutionarchitects/b2c-crm-sync/issues) for defects and known issues.  If you encounter a defect related to PersonAccounts, please go ahead and [create an issue](https://github.com/sfb2csolutionarchitects/b2c-crm-sync/issues/new/choose); it helps everyone.

```bash
sfdx force:source:deploy -p "src/sfdc/person-accounts"
```

> The deployment results will be output via the CLI.  Please note that these elements are a requirement for environments where personAccounts are enabled.

11. Use the below CLI command to retrieve configuration data needed for .env as outlined above.

```bash
sfdx force:org:display -u [scratchOrg-username]
```

> Copy the scratchOrg domain url and username to the .env file.  These values will be used to drive the creation of the B2C Commerce Service definitions that will enable integration with the Salesforce Platform.

12. Use the below CLI command to generate a password for the scratchOrg user that can be populated in .env as described above.

```bash
sfdx force:user:password:generate --targetusername [scratchOrg-username]
```

> Copy the generated user-password to the .env file.  This value will be used to drive the creation of the B2C Commerce Service definitions that will enable integration with the Salesforce Platform.

13. View the full detail of information about the scratchOrg user using the following CLI command:

```bash
sfdx force:user:display -u [insert-username]
```

> Copy the login-url domain to the .env file.  This value will be used to enable authentication to the scratchOrg from the B2C Commerce environment.

14.  In your scratchOrg, enter Setup and find the User avatar in the header (the avatar should look like Astro, and be displayed in the upper right corner of the browser.  Hovering over Astro will display the label "View Profile".

15.  Click on the User avatar and select the option titled **Settings**.  From the settings menu, click on the option titled **Reset Security Token** to generate a new token for your scratchOrg user.

> Please note that you will receive two emails declaring that a new securityToken has been generated.  The first is from the password reset that was performed.  The second is from this action.  Copy the securityToken from the second email to the .env file.

#### Setup ScratchOrg Authentication Credentials
B2C Commerce service definitions pointing to the deployed scratchOrg can be seeded with Salesforce environment authentication credentials.  To support this, please extend the .env file with the following properties representing authentication details for the scratchOrg.

- Open the .env file and edit the following information.  Please update these values to reflect the unique environment and authentication credentials for your scratchOrg.  These values can be used to validate authentication and seed the B2C Commerce service definitions with these details -- eliminating the need to manually configure these services.

> At this point, your scratchOrg should be created and the information displayed below should be available to you.  Please copy the corresponding scratchOrg configuration properties to this section of the .env file.

> Remember that these values need to be driven by your scratchOrg user and environment.  These values must be accurate to ensure that the B2C Commerce meta-data is successfully generated and supports the integration with the Salesforce Platform.

17.  Test your Salesforce Platform Configuration properties by executing the following CLI Command:

```bash
npm run crm-sync:sf:auth:usercreds
```

> This command will attempt to authenticate against the Salesforce scratchOrg using the environment and credential information provided in the previous step.  The CLI command will either return an error -- or return the authToken that was generated by the Salesforce Platform in response to the authentication request.

:warning: &nbsp; Only proceed to the next step if you are able to successfully validate that your Salesforce Platform Configuration Properties are able to successfully authenticate against your scratchOrg. &nbsp; :warning:

18. Generate the B2C Commerce metadata required by b2c-crm-sync and deploy both the code metadata to the Salesforce B2C Commerce instance by executing the following CLI command:

```bash
npm run crm-sync:b2c:build
```
> This CLI command will generate the services.xml file based on the previously generated connected apps step #4, generate a zip archive containing the metadata required by b2c-crm-sync, deploy this archive, generate a zip archive containing the b2c-crm-sync cartridges and deploy this archive to the B2C Commerce instance.

### Salesforce Customer 360 Platform Configuration Instructions

#### Assign the B2C Integration Tools Permission Set to the Administrator
b2c-crm-sync leverages a permission-set to provide application access to a user.  You can use this permission-set to assign the application to other users -- and customize it to align with your security priorities.

1.  Enter Setup (if it is not already opened).

2.  In the quick-find, search for Permission Sets.  Once located, select the Permission Sets setup option from the filtered setup menu.

3.  Open the **B2C Integration Tools** permission-set.  From its detail page, select the button labeled "Manage Assignments".

4.  From the assignment listing, please select the button labeled 'Add Assignment'.

5.  Assign the **B2C Integration Tools** permission-set to the Scratch Org Administrator (typically a user with the first and lastName of 'User').

6.  Save your changes by clicking on the 'Assign' button.  Click on the 'Done' button to confirm your changes and exit the permission-set display.

#### Configure Duplicate Rules Leveraged by b2c-crm-sync
b2c-crm-sync leverages match and duplicate rules to enforce the B2C Customer Data Strategy it employs.  These rules are leveraged to alert administrators of potential duplicate B2C Commerce Customer Profiles -- and assist in resolving customer profiles using a sub-set of customer attributes.

In the setup quick-find, search for Duplicate Rules (searching for 'dup' should bring up Duplicate and Match Rules).  Once located, select the Match Rules setup option from the filtered setup menu.

#### Account / Contact Match Rules Setup Guidance

> If you are setting up PersonAccounts, please skip this section and proceed to the section titled [PersonAccount Match Rules Setup Guidance](#personaccount-match-rules-setup-guidance).

- Ensure that the **B2C Commerce: Standard Contacts** Match rule is activated.  This rule must be active in the scratchOrg as part of the Accounts / Contacts implementation.  The corresponding duplicate rule is dependent on this Match Rule being activated.

#### Account / Contact Duplicate Rules Setup Guidance

From the duplicate rules listing, select the rule titled **B2C Commerce: Standard Contacts**.  Edit the rule from the detail display.

- Activate the Duplicate Rule by checking the activation checkbox.
- Under the Conditions section near the bottom of the form display, click on the link labeled 'Add Filter Logic'.
- Paste the following filter logic value in the field -- and save your results.

```bash
1 OR (2 AND 3) OR (2 AND 4 AND 5) OR (4 AND 5 AND 6)
```

#### PersonAccount Match Rules Setup Guidance

- Ensure that the **B2C Commerce Standard Person Account** match rule is activated.  This rule must be active in the scratchOrg as part of the PersonAccounts implementation.  The corresponding Duplicate Rule is dependent on this Match Rule being activated.

- Ensure that the **B2C Commerce: Standard Contacts** match rule is deactivated.  This rule must be not activated as part of the PersonAccounts implementation.

> The B2C Commerce: Standard Contacts should automatically be deactivated as part of the PersonAccounts meta-data deployment.

#### PersonAccount Duplicate Rules Setup Guidance

Leveraging the PersonAccount implementation requires a handful of additional configuration steps to disable the Contact match and duplicate rules -- and enable the related PersonAccount rules.

> The PersonAccount match and duplicate rules are disabled by default -- and must be activated manually through the Setup options of your Salesforce Org.

From the duplicate rules listing, select the rule titled **B2C Commerce: Standard Person Accounts**.  Edit the rule from the detail display.

- Activate the Duplicate Rule by checking the activation checkbox.
- Under the Conditions section near the bottom of the form display, click on the link labeled 'Add Filter Logic'.
- Paste the following filter logic value in the field -- and save your results.

```bash
1 OR (2 AND 3) OR (2 AND 4 AND 5) OR (4 AND 5 AND 6)
```

#### Create and Configure Your B2C Instance

1. Open the appLauncher, and search for 'CRM' in the quick-find. Verify that the **B2C CRM Sync** application is visible.

2. Select the **B2C CRM Sync** application and open it.  Verify that the B2C Instances, B2C CustomerLists, B2C Sites, Accounts, and Contacts tabs are visible from within the application.

3. Click on the B2C Instances Tab, and from the record-listing page click the 'New' button to create a new B2C Instance.

4. Enter a name for your B2C instance (whatever you want), check Is Active, select the appropriate Instance Type.

5. Populate the API URL with the host name of your B2C Instance.

6. Select the drop-down arrow next to the 'Printable View' quick action  in the top right of the B2C Instance record detail view and select 'Configure Instance Integration'.

> This assigns a Named Credential to the B2C Instance.  This Named Credential will be used to access the B2C Commerce environment's REST APIs.

7. Select the named credential ending with 'B2C: Client Credentials' and click 'Next'.  Verify that the named credential was successfully associated with the B2C Instance record.

8. Select the drop-down arrow next to the 'Printable View' quick action  in the top right of the B2C Instance record detail view and select 'Seed CustomerLists and Sites'.

> This will retrieve the configured list of B2C CustomerLists and Sites from the B2C Instance.  These records will be seeded in the b2c-crm-sync application, and will drive integration with B2C Commerce.

9. Select the drop-down arrow next to the 'Printable View' quick action  in the top right of the B2C Instance record detail view and select 'Activate B2C CustomerLists'.

> All integration can be managed via the Active and Permission Flags on the B2C Commerce Instance, CustomerList, and Site records.  Use these settings to control which sites and CustomerLists support integration with B2C Commerce.

#### Validate Your Installation
You can validate your installation by executing the Salesforce Platform Apex unit tests as well as the b2c-crm-sync multi-cloud unit-tests that are included with this enablement solution.

##### Executing Apex Tests

Apex unit-tests can be executed directly from the command-line via SFDX.  Please use this command to execute the Apex unit tests that are included with b2c-crm-sync:

```bash
sfdx force:apex:test:run
```
> The Apex unit-tests should return with a message providing instructions on how to view the test results.  For additional SFDX commands related to executing Apex tests, please visit the [Salesforce Platform CLI Refernece: Apex Commands](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_reference.meta/sfdx_cli_reference/cli_reference_force_apex.htm) page.

##### Executing Multi-Cloud Unit Tests

The multi-cloud unit-tests are designed to exercise your B2C Commerce Sandbox and Salesforce Platform ScratchOrg via REST APIs to validate the installation is successful.

> The B2C Commerce interactions are dependent on the deployment of the **RefArch and RefArchGlobal sites**.  Each site should be associated to its own separate CustomerList.

> :warning: &nbsp; Do not associate both sites to the same CustomerList -- as this will cause tests dependent on multiple customer-lists to fail. &nbsp; :warning:

Exercise the multi-cloud unit-tests by executing the following CLI command.  These tests exercise integration from both B2C Commerce and the Salesforce Platform:

```bash
npm run crm-sync:test:use-cases
```

> This CLI command will execute the multi-cloud unit tests designed to validate the Salesforce environment's duplicate management configuration, bi-directional customer profile synchronization between B2C Commerce and the Salesforce Platform, and progressive customer resolution scenarios.

#### What's Next?
At this point, you should be in a position to 1) start exercising the integration or 2) [ask a question](https://github.com/sfb2csolutionarchitects/b2c-crm-sync/discussions/new) or [log an issue](https://github.com/sfb2csolutionarchitects/b2c-crm-sync/issues/new) if the installation and configuration didn't complete as expected.  Please share your experience with us. :grin:

#### Let's End with Gratitude
I'd like to extend a heartfelt and personal thank you to everyone for their support, contributions, and guidance.  This has been a multi-year effort spanning multiple teams at Salesforce.  We've developed this data strategy and integration approach leveraging learnings from customers, partners, and our internal teams.  I am grateful for these relationships, and this project would not have come to life without the support of this group.
